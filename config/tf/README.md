There is a recipe available for [TensorFlow with LIBXSMM](https://libxsmm.readthedocs.io/tensorflow/) ([PDF](https://github.com/hfp/libxsmm/raw/master/documentation/tensorflow.pdf)). However, the recipe also contains information about building TensorFlow with Intel MKL and MKL-DNN (see section about [Performance Tuning](https://libxsmm.readthedocs.io/tensorflow/#performance-tuning-and-profiling)).
