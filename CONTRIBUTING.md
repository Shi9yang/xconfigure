There is high in interest in receiving recipes for scientific application and HPC applications in general. The project aims to be agile, fresh, and easy to use. There is no intent to gain a sophisticated infrastructure, or features that make up a package manager. The goal is to cover a recipe beyond written words, but to complement the scripts by a short text (explanation, limitations, etc.). The implementation is free of choice (Shell script, Python, etc.) as long as the prerequisites for the user stay in bounds (no burden).
